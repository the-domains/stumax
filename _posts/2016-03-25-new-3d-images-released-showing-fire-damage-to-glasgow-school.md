description: "New images have been released showing the damage caused to Charles Rennie Mackintosh's Glasgow School of Art building which was ravaged by fire almost two years ago. Flames engulfed the A-listed building on May 23 2014, leading to the loss of about a tenth of the structure and 30% of its contents around the time graduates were to display their works."
