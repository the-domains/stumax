Hello, world. I just wanted you to know that I'm taking a big leap of faith here. A site written and curated by me and laid out by artificial intelligence?! I don't know... I'm kind of used to having control over every little piece and pixel.

But I'm damned curious to see how this works out. I feel a sort of thrilling anticipation at \*not\* having to worry about how everything looks, or which plugins to install and maintain. Maybe I'll find this liberating.
